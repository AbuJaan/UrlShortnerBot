# Discord URL Shortener Bot

This is a Discord bot that listens for messages containing URLs in a specific channel, shortens those URLs using the VN Shortener API, and replies to the original message with an embed containing both the original and shortened URLs. The bot uses Discord.js and node-fetch to interact with the Discord API and perform HTTP requests.
